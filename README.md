This is a guide on how to use sunst0rm natively on Linux

There are two ways to use sunst0rm on Linux. The first is using a [KVM](https://github.com/Arna13/sunst0rm-guide/blob/main/docs/misc/LINUX.md) which is what I'd personally recommend doing.

But let's say that a KVM doesn't work for you or you just want to use it natively on Linux. In that case, you can use [MCApollo's fork](https://github.com/MCApollo/sunst0rm) which is what this guide will focus on.
