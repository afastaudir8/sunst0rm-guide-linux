# Getting started

Before using sunst0rm, you obviously need to install the dependencies first.

## Git
To install most, if not all, of the requirements, you'll need [git](https://git-scm.com/download/linux)

## libimobiledevice
Installing libimobiledevice on Linux is dependant on your distro. 

[The official website](libimobiledevice.org) lists how to do it on openSUSE, Ubuntu, and Debian. 

libimobiledevice is also on AUR for arch based systems.
